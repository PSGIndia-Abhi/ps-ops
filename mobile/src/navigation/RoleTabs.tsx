/**
 * Picks the one bottom-tab navigator that matches the signed-in user's
 * actual role (never hard-coded, never guessed - see auth/role.ts).
 *
 * Mobile is Technician/Supervisor only (business decision: Admin continues
 * on the web app/laptop). admin and branch_admin are grouped together here
 * deliberately, not split - the existing web app itself treats branch_admin
 * as an admin-tier role (frontend/src/auth/roleBasePath.js routes it to the
 * same "/admin" experience as admin, and its granted permissions include
 * branch-level user/role management - CREATE_USER, UPDATE_ROLE,
 * ASSIGN_BRANCH_ADMIN - that supervisor never has), so it is not a
 * supervisor-equivalent role and must not be mapped to Supervisor here.
 *
 * Any other role without a dedicated mobile dashboard (client,
 * temporary_worker, or nothing decoded yet) gets the same safe fallback -
 * never a crash, never the wrong role's dashboard.
